# Space-SHMUP
For our third project, I made a simple space SHMUP (“shoot ‘em up”) based on the old game Asteroids. The player controls a ship and moves it around the screen, trying to avoid and shoot down asteroids as they move past. 
 
If you are looking to play this game you can. All you have to do is download the whole Runnable folder. Then you can run the Project3.exe file and enjoy the game.
 
Part 1)
 
A start screen and end screen (e.g., new scenes, UI pop-ups, etc.)
 
UI elements for tracking game information (e.g., text displays for player lives and player score)
 
Audio (e.g., background music and sound effects for game events such as moving or firing)
 
Audio settings that are saved (e.g., mute and volume in PlayerPrefs)
 
High scores that are saved (e.g., top 5 high scores in PlayerPrefs)  
 
Must allow the player to control an object and move it around within the bounds of the screen 
 
Use keys (e.g., A/D or left/right arrows) to rotate the object 
 
Use a different key (e.g., W or up arrow) to move forward based on the current rotation  
 
Must spawn objects that move across the screen and destroy themselves when off the screen 
If one of these objects hits the player, destroy the player and make them lose a life  
 
Must allow the player to press a key/button to fire projectiles 
If one of these projectiles hits a spawned object, destroy it and award the player points 
Projectiles should destroy themselves when off the screen 
 
Must use at least two different particle effects (e.g., one for explosions and one for the player moving)  
 
Must provide an ending condition (e.g., earning a certain score, destroying all objects, running out of time) 

Part 2)

Must include at least one additional type of weapon

  Ex: rapid shot, spread shot, homing shot, a laser beam, etc.
  
  The player should be able to temporarily acquire this weapon as a power-up by passing over it
  
  This new weapon should be distinctly different than the standard weapon in both looks and behavior

  While the player has this weapon, its behavior should replace their standard weapon

Must include at least one additional type of enemy
  
  Ex: homing asteroids, enemy ships, asteroids that split into smaller asteroids when destroyed, etc.

  This enemy could be a single boss enemy or a randomly occurring standard enemy
  
  This new enemy should be distinctly different from the standard enemy in both looks and behavior
